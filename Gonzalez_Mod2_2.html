<h2>Chapter XIII: No Title</h2>

<p id="Intro">As a child my family moved a few times. I used to live in south Los Angeles. When I was in second grade my family moved to compton and there I stayed there three years. I moved to Utah and then we moved back to california in 6 months we moved 4 more times after that and now my family has been living in the High Desert of California for nearly 18 years. 

<p>I am very close to my family. <span class="sentence">I have to younger sibling a brother and a sister.</span> I dont have children.

<p>My hobbies aren't all that interesting. I watch anime and play games mostly Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts. Games and anime with intriguing stories are my favorite.

<p>I like to travel and wish I had more opportunities to do so. I have only gone to parts of Mexico and Ireland. The next place I want to visit is Japan to learn about the history and culture of the country.
