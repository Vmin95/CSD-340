    <h3>5 Things Iâ€™ve Learned Since the Course Started</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS is an easier way to format for HTML documents. However, im still used to the messy way of formatting in HTML since that was the way I initially learned when I was younger.</li>
        <li>I learned more HTML than I was privvy to before coming into the class. </li>
        <li>Im also learning how to be more attentive to details in the code I write in order to prevent consistant errors.</li>
        <li>People are less likely to visit pages that have too many visual distractions.</li>
        <li>HTML is fairly easy to write so far and CSS is pretty straightforward.</li>
